I Have only done a few things with astro, but as a newcomer it has been extremely well thought out. 
## The install
The command line install was probably the most user friendly command line tool I have ever used. Instructions on what to do exactly and what options to select are provided in the tutorial. 
## The tutorial
The tutorial lets you get going without having to know any sort of programming language. It makes it quite simple to get started and see something change as you type which is awesome when you are first starting. So far, all I have done is create the website, and add a few pages and posts. At it's current state, it is black text on a white background. I am sure we will get into some CSS styling of some sort soon.
