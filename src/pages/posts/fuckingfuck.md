## The downfall of professional writing

What the fuck is up fuckers. I am now going to be that bitch that is spewing
profanities in all my god damn blog posts. Some assholes might ask -- Do these
opinions represent your employer? Obviously these idiotic murmurs are not
associated with anyone but my stupid smooth brain.

Have you ever read some content and thought, "Wow, this sounds so professionally written. Almost too professionally written..."? I have had those thoughts a lot recently. I am guessing it is because the internet is being fucking swarmed with AI generated shit content. To make it abundantly clear - if it wasn't already from my shit writing - I will now be writing all my posts with profanities.

Ok, ok I will tone it down but not too much. This is me shouting into the fucking void. Look at my hit counter on my website. It is like 20 and 10 of those are probably me checking if the counter went up. What does it matter anyway? At least if someone finds this, they will think, "Wow a website this bad might be AI generated. No wait, this guy curses way too fucking much."
