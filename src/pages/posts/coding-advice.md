## What I have learned

As mentioned in the home page of the coding section on my website, I began my
coding journey first through some random youtube videos and then with some
coursera classes. The specific coursera course I took was the IBM data science
series. These were pretty nice if you know nothing about programming, but the
first few were very rudimentary. I think if you just need to learn the syntax of
something you should use youtube videos or other free resources like
[freecodecamp.org](https://www.freecodecamp.org) or other great online
resources. It can also be nice to follow a curriculum in a book. While I do not
have any specific reccomendations personally, I found
[thriftbooks](https://www.thriftbooks.com) to be awesome for finding used
textbooks for cheap. If you sign up for their rewards program, it is pretty easy
to start getting free books, although you are limited to books under $5. If you
have never seen thriftbooks you may think that $5 won't get you much but I just
got an old networking textbook for free with this! Another great resource is MIT
OpenCourseWare. There are so many free courses from fantastic professors with
assignments and recorded lectures to choose from. This is also a great way to
stick to a curriculum.

## Keep learning

The most important part is to keep learning. There is never a point where you
will know everything. You will always be looking up how to do something new or
for a new tool. This is ok. It does not mean you are a bad programmer or behind
in any ways. It just means that you are still learning (as is everyone else).
