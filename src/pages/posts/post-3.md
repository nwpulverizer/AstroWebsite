The astro tutorial reccomends you use Netlify or Vercel to host your website on the internet, but I had already paid for about two years on hostinger so I was really hoping to use their service. The problem with Hostinger is that it does not build the website for you, so you must "compile" your website and upload this compiled folder to hostinger manually or upload just the compiled folder to a git repo and use that. The only reason I was able to figure this out as a newbie was because the [Astro discord](https://astro.build/chat) has a support section. I had a response within 5 minutes. The consensus was that it is easier to just use Netlify or Vercel, especially considering they let you use your own domain even with the free tier.  The moral of the story is, joing the Astro discord if you have any trouble
