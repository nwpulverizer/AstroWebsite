I have had 3 different e-bikes now and one electric scooter. Maybe I am buying the cheap shit ones or something buy they all have this same annoying ass problem with the battery gauge. They use fucking voltage to tell me how much battery is left - stop it. Use the battery capacity. Do you fucking know what a voltage curve looks like for a lithium battery? Its not a fucking linear interpolation, it sits at like 3.7 volts for half of the discharge. That means your stupid fucking gauge says I am at like 60% battery for most of the time, then I get to 20% in like two fucking seconds. Just put a fucking shunt in and measure the current draw dude. Holy shit. We have figured this out billions of years ago. Why is this so complicated?? I wouldn't be surprised if the off the shelf BMS you use has a current measuring device built in and you just aren't fucking using it. Imagine being able to actually tell how much battery you have left from the percentage displayed to you? What a life. No? OK I guess I will just go fuck myself.
