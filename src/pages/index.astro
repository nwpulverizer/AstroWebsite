		<h1>Nathan's Hobbies</h1>
        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p> I am currently working through Astro's intro tutorial and trying to learn how to make my own website. I enjoy tinkering with all sorts of things like drones and 3D printers. I am currently enrolled in a PhD program studying Geochemistry. This site is a repository of my learning, frustrations and knoweledge I gain along the way. </p>
