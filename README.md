# Personal blog
This is the repo for my personal blog hosted on netlify at [nathanshobbies.com](https://nathanshobbies.com/)

Below is things I know need fixing. My priority as of 10/23/2023 is simply writing, so these may be unresolved for quite some time. Slowly they will be crossed off. 
# TODO in no particular order 
- [ ] Tame the gaudy color scheme. I was going for a Catppuccin theme but I really have no idea how to best implement this - when to use what colors where.  Maybe I should stick to something simpler.
- [ ] Tags index page has a horrible green color and grey text. You can barely read anything
- [x] ~~Remove the hello script on front page~~
- [x] ~~change favicon~~
- [x] ~~Better organize Home page. Items look not square with eachother. Titles, picturess, dates should be aligned with eachother~~
- [ ] Add some simple analytics - just view counts.
- [x] ~~Fix image on article "Hosting an astro website on Hostinger"~~
- [x] ~~Social links - These look bad and some don't even link to me like the twitter one. Remove completely since I don't have many socials or update.~~
- [x] ~~Update about page. It's just a wall of text and not any fun.~~
- [ ] Update all images in public to be astro <Image> tags instead. Consider removing images altogether at least from home page. 
- [x] ~~Redo hostinger article because my answer is really a cop out.~~
